description: The biobank stores longitudinal samples from whole blood (DNA/RNA), plasma, serum and cryopreserved PBMC, faeces, urine, and Cerebrospinal fluid. More than 1500 patients with various disease severity (mild, moderate, severe/critical) and with linked full medical status and history have been included and followed with blood sampling and clinical examination during the acute phase (d1,3,6,10, 14+) and after 3, 6, 12m+. Additionally, >200 hospital staff (ID Clinic) are longitudinal followed with blood sampling, PBMC and clinical data every 3m. Patients with long-term symptoms (n=150, previously hospitalized and patients referred from primary care) are followed in a separate project including blood and Cerebrospinal fluid.
